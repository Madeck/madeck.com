# My very own website

Even though this is public, it's probably not very interesting for now. I'm planning on having several test/lab projects that will hopefully be worth watching.

For now, I only have made a [card shuffler](http://madeck.com/cards/), a [basic canvas painter](http://madeck.com/test/) and a small [useragent tester](http://madeck.com/agent/).
